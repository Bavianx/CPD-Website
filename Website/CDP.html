    <p class="Dates"><b>Thursday 27th October - 5 hour shift    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Saturday 29th October - 5 hour shift </b> </p>
    <p class="work-CPD">During these shifts I was able to talk to my manager and get to know the new role that I have been placed into, this allowed me to better communicate with her as we were on different departments but are much more fluid when it comes to working together. As well as being able to contact and talk with several customers making me become much more comfortable with the role. In addition, I feel like I will be able to take this same confidence and energy into other aspects of my life whether it is making new friends or going into another job with new people, I will have the confidence to know I can talk to new people and create bonds with them. </p>

    <p class="Dates"><b>Tuesday 1st November | 2 hour class</b> </p>
    <p class="work-desc">During these classes today I was able to improve my knowledge with topics such as Computational Neuroscience, Security in your AI solutions autonomous vehicles and the one that attracted me most, Machine learning. During these classes I was able to see what these new topics are and into the future of what I would learn on a ‘Masters level grade’. Machine learning interested me the most and has sparked a new interest within me (CYBER INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM, DIFFERENT NETWORK ATTACKS, MISUSE-BASED (Signature based) IDS and MISUSE-BASED ID) and is something that I plan on learning in the future at the university during my second year as knowing these things will dramatically help me with my future in the Cyber Security space.  </p>

    <p class="Dates"><b>Tuesday 2nd November | 7 hours across 3 class</b></p>
    <p class="work-desc">During these classes today I was given a better understanding of employability and how I will be able to maximise my chances of being employed via the help and assistance of the staff at NTU. This can be achieved through going and talking to the ‘Employability team’ as well as the ‘MyEmployability’ App that will allow me to gain more knowledge on how to get into placements.
        <br><br>Fujitsu class was also really interesting, it took me in and really allowed me to understand the technological leap that we have taken over the past 20 years in ‘IT’ through the use of CCTV and facial recognition. The class also allowed me to view the positives and negatives of this technology and how appropriate this is to use in our day to day lives as well as the final class which allowed us to see people get their own face scanned where a software will guess their age based on how they look.
